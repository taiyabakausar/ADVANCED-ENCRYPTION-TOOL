The Advanced Encryption Tool is a Python-based application designed to securely encrypt and decrypt files using the AES-256 encryption algorithm. This tool provides a user-friendly command-line interface, allowing users to easily manage their files' security. The application ensures data confidentiality by transforming plaintext files into encrypted formats and vice versa, while also implementing file integrity checks to verify that files have not been altered during the encryption and decryption processes.

This project was developed as part of my internship to deepen my understanding of cryptography and secure data handling. The implementation leverages the cryptography library for encryption and decryption, ensuring robust security practices.

What I Learned:

How to implement AES-256 encryption and decryption using the cryptography library in Python.
The importance of secure key management and file integrity verification.
How to create a user-friendly command-line interface for interacting with encryption tools.
The principles of data confidentiality and the role of encryption in protecting sensitive information.
Best practices for handling and storing encryption keys securely.
